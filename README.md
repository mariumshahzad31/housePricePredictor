The House Price Predictor is a data science project developed using Python in Jupyter Notebook, designed to estimate house prices based on various factors such as location, size, and the number of bedrooms. The project involves data collection, preprocessing to handle missing values, and feature engineering to enhance model accuracy. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted using visualization libraries to understand trends and correlations in the dataset. Machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated using performance metrics like RÂ² score and RMSE. Hyperparameter tuning is applied to optimize the model's accuracy. The final model can be deployed using Flask or Django to create a user-friendly web application. This project showcases skills in data handling, predictive modeling, and deployment, making it a valuable addition to a data science portfolio.
